# Trillo Project

This is the second project of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Advanced CSS and Sass" course on Udemy, and my first to use Flexbox. I incorporated a more organized CSS architecture than was provided in the course, including modular CSS files, BEM methodology, and responsive mixins (Jonas incorporated these into a previous project, but said he didn't want to make them the focus of this project). Aside from this, I mostly replicated the project exactly as instructed, though I opted to use Gulp for various tasks.

I treated the project mostly as a playground for practicing Flexbox, so some aspects of the design were not perfected - particularly the responsive design, though it should suffice for the basics.
